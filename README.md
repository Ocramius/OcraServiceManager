# OcraServiceManager

OcraServiceManager is a Zend Framework 2 Module that decorates `Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager`
with the ability to generate lazily initialized service proxies.

It also integrates with [ZendDeveloperTools](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendDeveloperTools) 
to provide aid in logging what is happening between your dependencies, allowing you to produce
dependency graphs such as the following one:

![Example Dependency Graph generated by `OcraServiceManager`](http://yuml.me/1c92f6a5.png)

It is **heavily tested** and supports proxying of any possible object type.

If you don't know what proxies are, you can read my article about
[service proxies and why we need them](http://ocramius.github.com/blog/zf2-and-symfony-service-proxies-with-doctrine-proxies/).

## Installation

The recommended way to install
[`ocramius/ocra-service-manager`](https://packagist.org/packages/ocramius/ocra-service-manager) is through
[composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
php composer.phar require ocramius/ocra-service-manager
```

When asked for a version to install, type `dev-master`.
You can then enable it in your `config/application.config.php` by adding
`OcraServiceManager` to your modules.

## Configuration

Following config keys are provided by default, but you can change them as you want:

```php
return array(
    'ocra_service_manager' => array(
        // In DEV, you can turn this on to see dependencies in Zend Developer Tools
        'logged_service_manager' => false,
    ),
);
```

## Tweaking for production

Please be aware that the default settings will not make your application faster until
you set effective cache settings in `config.ocra_service_manager.cache`.

## Testing

After having installed via composer:

```sh
cd path/to/ocra-service-manager
phpunit
```

## Contributing

Please consider that any pull requests will be accepted only if:

 * code coverage on newly introduced code is >= 90%
 * the performance impact is acceptable (please run the performance test suite and attach
   its report to the pull request itself)

## Known limitations:

 * Currently only replaces only the main `service_manager` of your application.
 * Service proxies are useless if you initialize them via service initializers, since any call
   to a method of the proxy itself will initialize it.
